clean code must;

-I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The
logic should be straightforward to make it hard
for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to
ease maintenance, error handling complete
according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt
people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing
well.
