with ur?
“with ur” in a query tells DB2 that you want to use the Uncommitted Read isolation level.
The WITH clause specifies the isolation level at which the statement is executed. 
(Isolation level does not apply to declared temporary tables because no locks are acquired.)
```
U can use the following combination in WITH clause...
-CS Cursor stability
-UR Uncommitted read
-RR Repeatable read
-RR KEEP UPDATE LOCKS
Repeatable read keep update locks
-RS Read stability
-RS KEEP UPDATE LOCKS
Read stability keep update locks
```
