# Day-1
Variables in JavaScript
var, const, let
You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:

var — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when the code is executed.
const — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.
let — Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

Array Methods
Once you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:

concat() — Join several arrays into one
indexOf() — Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array
join() — Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string
lastIndexOf() — Gives the last position at which a given element appears in 
an array

# Day-3
pop() — Removes the last element of an array
push() — Add a new element at the end
reverse() — Sort elements in a descending order
shift() — Remove the first element of an array

# Day-4
slice() — Pulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array
sort() — Sorts elements alphabetically
splice() — Adds elements in a specified way and position

# Day-5
toString() — Converts elements to strings
unshift() —Adds a new element to the beginning
valueOf() — Returns the primitive value of the specified object

# Day-9
Outputting Data
A common application for functions is the output of data. For the output, you have the following options:

alert() — Output data in an alert box in the browser window
confirm() — Opens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click
[https://websitesetup.org/javascript-cheat-sheet/]

# Day-10
console.log() — Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purposes
document.write() — Write directly to the HTML document
prompt() — Creates a dialogue for user input

# Day-11
Global Functions
Global functions are functions built into every browser capable of running JavaScript.

decodeURI() — Decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) created by encodeURI or similar
decodeURIComponent() — Decodes a URI component
encodeURI() — Encodes a URI into UTF-8
[https://websitesetup.org/javascript-cheat-sheet/]

# Day-12
encodeURIComponent() — Same but for URI components
eval() — Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string
isFinite() — Determines whether a passed value is a finite number
[https://websitesetup.org/javascript-cheat-sheet/]

# Day-13
isNaN() — Determines whether a value is NaN or not
Number() —- Returns a number converted from its argument
[https://websitesetup.org/javascript-cheat-sheet/]

# Day-14
parseFloat() — Parses an argument and returns a floating-point number
parseInt() — Parses its argument and returns an integer
[https://websitesetup.org/javascript-cheat-sheet/]

# Day-15
JavaScript Loops
Loops are part of most programming languages. They allow you to execute blocks of code desired number of times with different values:

for — The most common way to create a loop in JavaScript
while — Sets up conditions under which a loop executes
do while — Similar to the while loop but it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again

break —Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions
continue — Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met

Escape Characters
In JavaScript, strings are marked with single or double-quotes. If you want to use quotation marks in a string, you need to use special characters:

\' — Single quote
\" — Double quote
Aside from that you also have additional escape characters:

\\ — Backslash
\b — Backspace
\f — Form feed
\n — New line
\r — Carriage return
\t — Horizontal tabulator
\v — Vertical tabulator
